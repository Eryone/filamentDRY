## Improve Your Print Quality with ERYONE filament Dryer

#### Why dry your filament?

 Many people start to see quality imperfections when they have filament filled with moisture.
 
Filament storage methods   

#### How does it work?

After heating, the internal water molecules will move to the surface of the filament and accelerate the evaporation.

Here is the surface temperature of the dryer box that can help us to understand the temperature inner area of the box.

#### What makes it special

1. Makes a noticeable difference for your printing; 

2. Keeps filament dry and gives it a nice mechanism to roll on.
With dryer box you can feed the filament to your printer directly from the dryer. That way,the filament stays dry until it reaches the nozzle and gets extruded.

3. Heating and Desiccants,the heating not only dry the filament but also baking the reusable silica gel desiccants in the bottom of the box , the desiccants will keep the box always in low humidity after heating for a long time.



 
2rd Level |  Heating plate 80C |	Temperature Displayed >54C | RH <20%
--- | --- |--- |--- 
Without filament |   minutes |	 minutes |	  minutes
With 1Kg full filament | 30 minutes |	  minutes |	 minutes

 
3rd Level |  Heating plate 90C |	Temperature Displayed >54C | RH <20%
--- | --- |--- |--- 
Without filament | 5 minutes |	30 minutes |	30 minutes
With 1Kg full filament | 40 minutes |	120 minutes |	120 minutes

The Hygrometer/Thermometer and the heating are 2 different independent systems,
The thermometer on the top side will display the actual point temperature and humidity that is  far from the heating bed. So the temperature in the other place in the box probably higher,especially at the bottom near the heating bed that will higher than 60 degree,so do not dry the PLA with 3rd level.


How to dry the desiccants? The easy way is put your desiccants on the printer heat bed,and heating the bed to the 90 degree for several hours.
